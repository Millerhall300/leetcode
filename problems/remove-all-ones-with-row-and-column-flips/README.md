### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Does the order, in which you do the operations, matter?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
No, it does not. An element will keep its original value if the number of operations done on it is even and vice versa. This also means that doing more than 1 operation on the same row or column is unproductive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Try working backward, start with a matrix of all zeros and try to construct grid using operations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Start with operations on columns, after doing them what do you notice about each row?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Each row is the exact same. If we then flip some rows, that leaves only two possible arrangements for each row: the same as the original or the opposite.
