## [761. Special Binary String (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-binary-string "特殊的二进制序列")

<p><i>Special</i> binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of 0&#39;s is equal to the number of 1&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1&#39;s as 0&#39;s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a special string <code>s</code>, a <i>move</i> consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of <code>s</code>, and swapping them. <i>(Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)</i></p>

<p>At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = &quot;11011000&quot;
<b>Output:</b> &quot;11100100&quot;
<b>Explanation:</b>
The strings &quot;10&quot; [occuring at s[1]] and &quot;1100&quot; [at s[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li><code>s</code> has length at most <code>50</code>.</li>
	<li><code>s</code> is guaranteed to be a <i>special</i> binary string as defined above.</li>
</ol>

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Draw a line from (x, y) to (x+1, y+1) if we see a "1", else to (x+1, y-1).
A special substring is just a line that starts and ends at the same y-coordinate, and that is the lowest y-coordinate reached.
Call a mountain a special substring with no special prefixes - ie. only at the beginning and end is the lowest y-coordinate reached.
If F is the answer function, and S has mountain decomposition M1,M2,M3,...,Mk,  then the answer is:
reverse_sorted(F(M1), F(M2), ..., F(Mk)).
However, you'll also need to deal with the case that S is a mountain, such as 11011000 -> 11100100.
